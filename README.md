# LooSchedule

### What is LooSchedule:  
Loo-Schedule is an initiative designed to assist students in the Mathematics faculty by providing an automated system for generating their course schedules in accordance with their degree requirements, co-op sequence, desired course load per term, and course availability. For example, Loo-Schedule can offer users personalized recommendations for elective courses, based on individual course preferences. After the user sets their degree goal, Loo-Schedule can generate a course routine to help users thrive towards the goal. If the user is unsure whether he/she has fulfilled the graduation requirements, Loo-Schedule can showcase all leftover required courses.
